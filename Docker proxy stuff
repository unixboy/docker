RUN export http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade


before any apt-get command in your Dockerfile you should put this line

COPY apt.conf /etc/apt/apt.conf

Dont'f forget to create apt.conf in the same folder that you have the Dockerfile, the content of the apt.conf file should be like this:

Acquire::socks::proxy "socks://YOUR-PROXY-IP:PORT/";
Acquire::http::proxy "http://YOUR-PROXY-IP:PORT/";
Acquire::https::proxy "http://YOUR-PROXY-IP:PORT/";


	
 
Dockerfile:

ADD script.sh /tmp/script.sh
RUN /tmp/script.sh
script.sh:

if ping -c 1 google.com ; then
    echo "direct internet  "
else
    echo "proxy environment detected setting proxy"
    export http_proxy=<proxy address>
fi
